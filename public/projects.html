    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h4>This is a list of the programming projects I have done or been a part of. Each project was made using the programming languages and technologies shown in the 
        <a href="programming.html" class="thesis">"programming skills" page</a></h4>
    <p><b>Instagram app "Pointsi"</b></p>
    <p>This app was commissioned through school. 
        Mostly done by myself, but some of the styling (css) was made by two other persons.
    Basic idea of the app was to take pictures for example at restaurants
    and then tag the place you took the photo at to earn some credits to spend.

        <p><b>Oulu environment game</b></p>
    <p>Oulu environment game was commissioned by the city of Oulu. The game was aimed to teach childrens importancy of environmental issues.

    <p>I made slot machine for the company I was working as a trainee. You could win discount codes for the companys services by playing the slot machine.

        <p><b>Several websites</b></p>
    <p>Pretty basic websites containing some kind of database for registration, signing up and other stuff like shop.
         Most of them were made in the first year of studies and unfortunately I dont have any footage saved
