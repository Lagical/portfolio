        <p><b>Instagram app "Pointsi"</b></p>
        <p>This app was commissioned through school.
            Mostly done by myself, but some of the styling (css) was made by two other persons.
            Basic idea of the app was to take pictures for example at restaurants
            and then tag the place you took the photo at to earn some credits to spend.
